                  <p>Helllooo I’m Paula.</p>
                  <p>At the age of 10 I remember walking past a photography studio in the city. A particular black and white image that hung in the window caught my attention and the desire to capture lives through a lens was birthed. My eagerness to pursue this as a career however soon took a backseat as I was determined to be different to my older sister who had chosen a similar path leaving school.</p>                  
                  <p>But after years of exploring other areas such as fashion and the arts there was nothing that came close to fulfilling the feeling I had when I was behind the camera. I love telling stories through my photos. I think it is such a privilege to be able to capture moments in peoples lives. Moments like a wedding day might only happen once and I have the opportunity to capture the day as it unfolds, making moments that only last a few seconds stand still for a lifetime.</p>
                  <p>I get to share this with my husband Nick, who shoots with me which I think is pretty cool too!</p>
