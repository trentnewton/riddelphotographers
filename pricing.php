                  <p>We love to tell stories!</p>
                  <p>Nick and I both strongly believe that your wedding day should be just that and nothing else! It is a day that you get to share with friends and family as you celebrate just how in love you are and we never want to get in the way of that! When we shoot a wedding, we take more of a documentary type of approach where we aim to capture your special moments in their truest form.</p>
                  <p>Wedding coverage starts at $2000. If you are interested in having us as your wedding photographers or you’d like to see our full price list, then head over to our <a href="/riddelphotographers/contact.php">contact page</a> and send us a quick email to tell us all about your day!</p>
                  <p>Family shoots, portraits, engagement shoots and newborns all start at $250.</p>
