                  <p>First and foremost I need to say a big sorry for being rather slack in keeping you all up to date with what Paula Kern Photography has been up to! What a busy last couple of months it has been for us, with traveling around Europe for most of that time and then jumping straight back into things with no chance to catch our breath… but no excuse!</p>
                  <p>So to bring you back in the loop, please meet the lovely Ryan and Jess! I could not speak more highly of this couple! These two certainly know how to have a good laugh and were up for any adventure we threw their way. We decided to go for a bit of a drive and see what we could find and ended up somewhere in Samford pulled up on the side of the road, climbing fences and trekking through long grass, praying we don’t get too friendly with any snakes just to make use of the beautiful location and incredible light.</p>
                  <p>Hope you enjoy scrolling through the photos as much as I loved snapping them!</p>
                  <p>Ps. In case you didn’t know Ryan is a killer guitar player and Jess has one incredible voice so if you are looking for a wedding singer, I promise you, you will not be disappointed with these two! Make sure you head over to J&R Music on Facebook to check them out!</p>
